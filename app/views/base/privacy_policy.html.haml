      WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE?
    %p
      We use reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. For example, when we communicate with Paypal, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software that makes unauthorized access difficult. However, we restrict access to employees, contractors or agents who need to know personal information to operate, develop or improve the site that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us at
      %a{:href => "mailto:info@savetogether.org"}="info@savetogether.org"
      if you believe your password has been misused.
