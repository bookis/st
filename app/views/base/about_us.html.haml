            CO-FOUNDER, CEO
          %p
            Dylan is a former management consultant with Accenture and a licensed attorney. At Accenture, he led teams performing strategy, business process, product management and IT consulting for multiple Fortune 100 companies and start-ups.

          %p
            He has significant work experience in Asia, Africa, and Europe and has traveled to over 20 countries.  His passion for matched savings was born out of his recent Kiva fellowship in Ghana where he saw first hand the benefits of improving access to financial services for the working poor.
          %p
            While not working to change the world one saver at a time, Dylan enjoys sailing his 28-foot sailboat Saoirse or revising his first novel â€“ yet again.

              TOM BOSTELMANN
            CO-FOUNDER, CTO
          %p
            Originally from Minneapolis, Tom moved to Seattle to develop open-source software and is an IP Consultant and software architect in the Seattle area.  In 2000 he worked for a 'social business' (a term Muhammud Yunus coined) called Viatru that provided U.S. market opportunities for artisans in developing countries.
          %p
            Tom has also served several years as a volunteer teacher with organizations such as Technology Access Foundation and BDPA.  Finally, Tom has taken Muhammud Yunus' pledge to end poverty and he hopes that his work with SaveTogether will contribute to that.
