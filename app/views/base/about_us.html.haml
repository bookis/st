          Dylan is a former management consultant with Accenture and a licensed attorney.

          Tom Bostelmann | Co-Founder, CTO
        %span.text12
          %br/
          Tom is originally from Minneapolis (home is where your down-jacket is) where he was raised by teachers and social workers. He moved to Seattle to develop open-source software and is currently an IP consultant working for Intellectual Ventures. Tom also volunteers for the Grameen Foundation's MIFOS project where he is a committer, serves as the coordinator for Contemplative Outreach Northwest, and plays the bassoon with the Puget Sound Symphony Orchestra.  In 2000 he worked for a 'social business' (a term Muhammud Yunus coined) called Viatru that provided U.S. market opportunities for artisans in developing countries. He has also served several years as a volunteer teacher with organizations such as Technology Access Foundation and BDPA.  Finally, Tom has taken Muhammud Yunus' pledge to end poverty and he hopes that his work with SaveTogether will contribute to that.
