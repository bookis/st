                Each year Federal and state governments provide $500 billion in tax incentives for higher education, home ownership, business and retirement savings.  The lionâ€™s share of these tax incentives flow to the top 20% of tax payers, while less that 3% reaches the bottom 3/5 of American families.  Yet we know from 20 years of rigorously evaluated demonstrations that given the opportunity, low-inome and even very poor families will save, learn, work and invest and ultimately, go to college, start a business, buy a home, save for retirement and craft economic futures for their families and their country.

                Four legislative proposals with bipartisan support are being considered in Congress, each of which would extend matched savings opportunities to millions of working American Families:

              %h4
                = link_to "Savings for Working Families Act", 'http://www.cfed.org/'
              %p
                This would expand the largest current Federal matched savings program, the Assets for Independence Act from 50,000 low income families who work, save, learn and invest to three million.

              %h4
                = link_to "The ASPIRE Act", 'http://www.cfed.org/'
              %p
                Which would create an account at birth for each of the 4 million children born each year, with a $500 deposit for every child, and an additional $500 for the poorest third of kids.  What difference would it make if every child grew up knowing she or he had a nest egg for college, business or a home?

              %h4
                = link_to "Expanding the Savers Credit", 'http://www.cfed.org/'
              %p
                As the Obama Administration has proposed, would create a $500 match for 60 million families who do not currently benefit from our $500 billion dollars in annual incentives to families to save for retirement, homes, and educations.

              %h4
                = link_to "Entrepreneurship Tax Credit", 'http://www.cfed.org/'
              %p
                This could speed millions of low-income and poor entrepreneurs into the mainstream economy by lifting the punitive tax burden on these new self employed who currently must pay double what wage earners do.
