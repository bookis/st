She went back later and got a GED, then a Bachelors degree, and is now working towards her Masters. She came to Spokane from Yakima (in Central Washington) nine years ago, with her five children, Brenda 24, Emanuel 21, Jasmine 19, Adam 17, and Hannah 14.  Carmen feels time spent on children is time worthwhile.  She has instilled a respect for education in her children, four of whom are in college, three of them earning scholarships to pay the way. Emanuel and Adam have both done some of their school work in Italy. Hannah is in the Spokane Area Children's Choir, and is also a Girl Scout.  Carmen would like her children to have middle class opportunities, even while they are still living in poverty. She believes dreams and long term goals are worth fighting for.  Her savings goal is $2000, which she is accomplishing by considering her monthly savings amount as part of her bills. To do this, she cuts back on things like coffee, and has quit smoking.  She is learning to budget, manage credit, and have a good relationship with her bank. Carmen wants to be a homeowner because she feels it's an investment in the future. It will give her more freedom and security. She would love to find a home in Western Washington, where her father lives.  As the oldest sibling, she believes it is her responsibility to take care of her dad, like she took care of her mom before she passed away. She looks forward to having a good home where family can come home to.  Carmen looks toward the future, and is definitely trying to move forward."

He liked California, but he loves it here in Spokane. He is a single adult with two children, Tiffany 21 and Robert 27. Dale was raised in the 70's -- the smoke pot and live free era -- but having children quickly taught him the need to grow up and become responsible. Dale now works for Goodwill in a program called Goodworks, where he oversees janitorial accounts and employees. He makes sacrifices to make sure he pays into his savings every month. He skips movies and little wants, and tries to go for just the needs, because he realizes budgeting and saving is what's going to help him reach his goals. Dale wants to start a custom dressmaking and tailoring business. He started sewing in high school and realized he had a knack for it, so he went to Los Angeles Trade-Technical College and specialized in Fashion Design. He then worked in a tailoring business where he learned the custom sewing business. He has been doing special projects for a couple of years but wants to expand his business, get better equipment, purchase a computer, advertise on the internet and join the Chamber of Commerce. His goals are to work hard on his own to build a good foundation, then grow the business and create jobs for other hardworking people.  Then, once his business becomes stable and profitable, he would like to start saving for a home."

Natalia's husband is in construction work, and she works as a part-time caregiver, in addition to caring for her children and her elderly Mother-in-law who lives with them.

He has two children by a previous marraige, Jasmin, 18 months, and Isaac, 13 years old, who he spends a great deal of time with.  He is energetic and motivated, working two jobs and going to school full time. Alcohol addiction was present in his family when he was young, and in his own early adult life. Raymond has overcome that addiction and has been sober for 2 years now. He works part time for the Community Detox Center and also part time for the Nez Perce Tribal Fire Management Crew.  He is on the Board of the Native American Student Organization at Spokane Falls Community College, and also on the board for VOICES, a grass-roots advocacy organization of low income people. He helps VOICES with their monthly dinner and program. He enjoys helping others to alleviate his own stress.  Raymond’s expenses include rent, utilities, child support, and auto maintenance. He works weekends and varying shifts and has school (currently in summer school), homework, kids, and family to maintain. He also helps his mom and 5 brothers and sisters. To accomplish all of this he has cut out many personal wants and needs, cutting out movies and restaurants, and using libraries and used clothing stores. His advice for other savers is:  “Look at the bigger picture - where do you want to be in 5 years?  Learn the difference between wants and needs.”  Raymond’s goal is to start as a one-person fire crew contractor.  He would like to purchase a reliable 4 wheel drive Pickup and purchase personal supplies to sell to crew members during the season. He knows himself how hard it is to purchase these things when you are on-site and away from towns. He would like to eventually expand, purchase a chain saw and snow plow for the pickup. As his business grows, he hopes it will open the door to doing fire management logging through the Nez Perce Tribe. He would be interested in hiring displaced adults. Raymond has set his goals and is working hard toward them.    "

She overcame drug addiction at the age of 28, and has been clean and sober for 5 years now, motivated primarily by the hurt she could see in her daughter’s eyes and her desire to give Jazzmine a good life.  Wendi is a former welfare recipient, but has now gotten her Master's Degree and works full-time as a case manager helping people with AIDS. When she’s not working, she is an advocate for cultural awareness in the schools, and is involved in her daughter's sports programs. Her mom lives across the street and has been a great support to her. Wendi budgets her money, and feels putting money in a matched savings account is a winning strategy. Saving $2000 turns into $6000, an amount that would be almost impossible for her to save on her own. Wendi believes owning a home would be a foundation for Jazzmine and give her peace and stability. She would like to buy a home in a middle class neighborhood with 3 bedrooms, preferably a 2 story brick house. She is looking into a variety of First Time Home Buyer programs, and is hoping she will be ready to buy in a year.  Wendi feels she is becoming a productive citizen, someone who can give to society, not take away, and most of all a good example to her daughter."

She began with a booth at the International Gift Show in Los Angeles in 1999. Though she didn’t make much money, Agnes learned several important lessons and left the show inspired to do more. She headed north and began selling her jewelry and array of Kenyan products at the Ashby Flea Market in Berkeley. Today, Agnes lives in Oakland and is the proud owner of Kenyan Safari Designs. Her best-selling products are colorful hand-made jewelry and wooden utensils she buys directly from Kenyan suppliers. What started in a single stall has expanded to two, and Kenyan Safari Designs is now a profitable business that also sells wholesale products to retail shops in Oakland. After six months in the matched savings program, Agnes has saved $700 and has stopped using credit cards for business expenses. She plans to invest her savings and matching funds in a storefront in Oakland, where she can run her business every day of the week and keep a larger inventory for her wholesale customers. Smiling, Agnes remarks on how relieved she is to be out of credit card debt and to be pursuing her dream of running her own business."

She is saving to pay for tuition and supplies. Growing up as the first generation born in the United States in a family of immigrants, Janet struggled to translate for her family members and to help them access services they needed to start a new life in this country. Janet believes that it is critical for people to be aware of the services available to them, and has grown passionate about nonprofit management and marketing community services to those in need. She hopes to use her degree and business skills to open a shelter in the Bay Area, volunteer at local organizations, and assist other nonprofit organizations in marketing their services and products effectively. When she launches her own enterprise, Janet looks forward to financing it through a loan from Opportunity Fund’s lending program. For now, through the matched savings program, she is saving for the first time in her life, seeing the long-term benefits of saving versus the instant gratification of spending. After taking Opportunity Fund’s financial education course, Janet realized she was spending more than she earned, and she has now established a strict personal budget and uses QuickBooks to stick to it. She has already withdrawn almost $3,000 of savings and match funds to pay for tuition and will continue to save to get herself through school. Her advice is: “The resources are out there.  If you want to do it, there’s a way.”"

Maria has faced many hardships in her quest to operate her own business. She initially came to the United States planning to run a seamstress shop for 2 years, save some money, and return to Mexico. Now, 9 years have passed, and although she has come a long way from her first job in the lettuce fields, she is still struggling to establish herself as a professional housecleaner. Prior to joining the matched savings program, the thought of saving never crossed Mariaﾒs mind, but after attending financial education classes and opening her account, she has saved $30 a month for over a year. She is saving for a carpet cleaner to boost her business. She would also like to save for a car so that she can expand her client base.  She now travels by public transportation, carrying all of her cleaning supplies with her. Currently, Maria has three steady clients, but needs to increase sales in order to move her family out of the hotel in which they live and into an apartment for a more permanent and stable lifestyle. Maria has already invested some of her savings and match money to buy insurance for her business, and hopes that her additional savings will enable her to expand the business and eventually allow her to make enough money to fulfill her dream of opening a seamstress shop.

After working as a hair stylist for 8 years, Sandra took a leap and rented a station at a barbershop in her neighborhood. Within eight months she had an established client base and decided to open her own Spanish-speaking salon. She has been running Sandra’s, a full service salon, for three years and is breaking even on the business, but she struggles to make ends meet. Sandra joined the matched savings program to save money for her business. By keeping her salon open late every Wednesday, Sandra saved an extra $1000 last year and continues to save $120 every month in the matched savings program. She has already invested about $1500 of savings and matching funds in beauty supplies to keep her salon running. Sandra’s long-term vision is to open a second salon in Hayward and, eventually, to open a chain of salons in the Bay Area. The matched savings program and financial education have helped her set goals to turn her dream into reality. When Sandra is not busy running her salon, where she works from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., seven days a week, or spending time with her family, she plans for the future. Sandra advises keeping personal and business finances separate, investing rather than spending savings, and “never giving up when it gets hard.” As she prepares for her next client, Sandra smiles and says, “Keep trying and you’ll make it happen.”"

As a single mother of two living in Oakland, Sandra first earned her A.A. in Accounting at Laney College, and went on to earn a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration at Cal State Hayward. While attending classes and raising her family, Sandra gained skills preparing taxes for individuals and small businesses, and she recognized a need for such services in the Latino community. Four years ago, Sandra decided to meet this need and launch her own accounting business. Today, she has over fifty private clients in the Latino community, frequently making house calls, while also working full time as Accounting Manager at a construction company in San Francisco. Strategies for saving come naturally to Sandra, and she is a disciplined spender. She buys lunch out only once a week, doesn’t carry more than $20 cash, is careful about credit cards, and always buys in bulk. Since she began working with Opportunity Fund’s matched savings program last year, she has successfully saved $75 each month. She recently invested some of her savings in a new computer and printer for her business, and continues saving for a laptop that she can use when she visits clients’ homes. Sandra’s goals for the next five years are to see her two children attend college, to continue to build her business and to pursue a Masters degree in Taxation. In ten years’ time, she hopes to be running her company full-time. She believes that “there are no limits. People set their own limits.”"

At 20 years old, Andria has had to become a breadwinner in a large household including her mother, two sisters, a brother and her grandmother, providing for her family by working roughly 40 hours a week at the Roxbury Community College Childcare Center. 

She is already juggling quite an array of tasks for a young woman, supporting her family financially as well as physically: Andria also lends a hand helping take care of her elderly grandmother. 

Although some may think she is overextending herself, Andria is determined to pursue her educational goals.  She’s trying to set aside $100 from each paycheck in her Dotwell/Midas matched savings account to save towards schooling.  She has already made one matched withdrawal from her account to pay tuition for Pine Manor College—a college education which she believes is crucial to reversing her family’s financial woes.  “College is the key to freedom,” explains Andria.  “This is the only way I will get anywhere in life and achieve the things I want to achieve.”"

She had been brought up with a great respect for education, her family in Uganda doing whatever it took to put together money for school fees. Carolyn has just completed the Year Up program, which provided her with an internship and a first look at college classes in the US. She heard about the matched savings program at JVS/Midas through people working for Year Up.

Carolyn worked hard in school and has managed to be a good saver despite her limited income. She especially found the financial literacy and budgeting component of the program extremely helpful. “Before, if I got money, I would spend it and had trouble paying bills at the end of the month. Now I can follow a budget and save. I learned to buy only what I need. Even after the matched savings program I will now be putting money aside for my education.”

Carolyn had been studying to be a physical therapist in Uganda. She continued her interest in the healthcare field by working for a rehabilitation center in Quincy. Now she is elated to have been accepted to the nursing program at UMass Boston.  The matched savings program will be an important part of helping her through. “This money will be essential for books and tuition,” Carolyn explains. “Not having to put all that money from my pocket for books will allow me to continue to buy essentials such as food, clothing, and transportation.” The matched savings program will be the extra boost she needs so that one day she can help care for people as a nurse.

In addition to being a young college student at Cambridge College in Lawrence, she also works part-time and volunteers as a liaison to the Latino community, helping organize events and recruit students. 

Last year her husband of three years lost his job and for some time the couple had to depend solely on the earnings of her part-time job to make ends meet. This was an incredible challenge in itself, on top of trying to save $75/month for the matched savings program.  But she overcame this obstacle by using the budgeting skills she learned in her financial training with LCW.  

Fanny and her husband are doing better, and have even begun to save more money in a Savings Club.  However she now works an additional part-time job to help pay for school books and student loans.  Although this means that she can reach her goal faster, working two jobs as a full time student forces her to sacrifice her weekends and valuable time with her husband.  Fortunately, her determination helps her focus on her future.  She says that writing down her goals has helped her stay focused and learn to prioritize her “needs” over her “wants.”

Her goal is to save $1,500 for the matched savings program to invest in her education and pursue her dream of earning a graduate degree in Management. Her dream is strengthened and reaffirmed by her confidence in the opportunities it will bring and the urgency to bring her experiences as a Latina immigrant to management-level decision-making."

Nevertheless, her strong courage and stern will have allowed her to move forward where others may have crumbled.

At 24, Theresa had worked numerous odd jobs and attended school attempting to gain a degree in engineering or liberal arts, but stopped after not feeling it was her life’s true calling.  Later that year, she became pregnant with an autistic child.  Having a son born and diagnosed with autism, Theresa’s life directed itself toward helping people who need extra special care.

After securing a job at Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) as unit coordinator, her life seemed to be pointing toward a certain direction, her true calling: a nurse.  At 30 years old, Theresa is currently enrolled in classes to secure her CNA (certified nurse’s assistant) and eventually hopes to become an RN (registered nurse) with the help of the Dotwell/Midas matched savings program.

Raising a child with autism is a full-time job in itself.  Combined with the 32-40 hours a weeks Theresa works at BIH, she still struggles to make ends meet for her family.  Add on a desire to go to school and the ability to provide for her son financially and as a mother, Theresa is the type of person this community needs as a RN at our local health centers.

Wanda remembers translating for her mother during many job interviews, even when her own English was not yet fluent.  Today, Wanda works at the local Housing Court. She is saving $75/month – which is always a struggle with three children to raise and expenses piling up all the time.  She manages by using the budgeting skills she has learned in the LCW/Midas matched savings program and by making a habit and a priority out of saving.  In addition, she says the peer support that her matched savings group provides for each other is very helpful for staying on track.

Wanda will invest her savings and the match in purchasing her first home.  Her dream is to own a ranch-style house with a yard, and with rooms that she and her family can paint in any color they choose.  Most of all she wants a place where she and her family feel safe.  She is trying to save extra money, and also plans to take a first-time homebuyer seminar so she can be well-prepared for homeownership.

Speaking of her future home, Wanda says, “It will be an investment that… will help my kids to set up their own goals in the future and work on them until they get it. It all started with the matched savings program and now I feel empowered and dedicated to continue with this goal until it is accomplished.”
