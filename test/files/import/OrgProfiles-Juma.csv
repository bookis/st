","Juma's mission is to break the cycle of poverty by ensuring that young people complete a four-year college education. We support young people who have the motivation to succeed in college but lack the resources that they need to make their dream a reality. Through a first job, financial literacy training and matched savings, academic support, and one-on-one coaching with Juma staff, Juma youth are beating the odds. In 2009, for the third year in a row, 97% or more of the high school seniors at our flagship San Francisco program are going to college. The savings that youth develop through Juma's IDA program ensure that they will be able to stay in school and complete their degree.","Jumalogo09.jpg","image/jpg"
