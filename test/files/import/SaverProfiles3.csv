Sometimes they had to rush to a cafe so he could finish his homework.  After going with his mother to EARN's orientation about the matched savings program, Octavio went to work with her to save some of his own money and augment her savings so they could reach the goal and afford a new computer. Adriana said: ""I could see the financial education class really helped us plan together -- we wanted to deposit $85 monthly, but we realized we could only deposit $50. My son deposited half and I deposited the other half.""  Recently Adriana used some of their EARN savings and match to buy a computer for Octavio, who still looks at the computer and marvels at their achievement.  The EARN program has turned both Adriana and Octavio into lifetime savers, and their goal is to use the rest of their savings to start a college fund for Octavio. "
"EARN","EARN_Maria_N.jpg","sfearn+marian@savetogether.org","Maria","Nocedal","San Francisco","CA","Business","$2,000.00","Maria's dream for the people's legal center began in middle school in Los Angeles, when she saw her friends being lined up against a wall and harassed because they dressed and looked like gang members.  She decided then and there that she wanted to do something to inform people of their basic legal rights. It has been a long road filled with obstacles, but Maria is now the director of the organization she started two years ago in San Francisco.  She is a passionate, tenacious educator who even spent a year commuting to law school in Michigan to better develop her business plan and help her community. Her legal center focuses on education and representation for youth and seniors in her Excelsior neighborhood  She believes lawyers should act as servants to the people.  Her greatest sense of accomplishment came when she organized a volunteer-run immigration workshop for people ages 5 to 70.  The participants left armed with knowledge and committed to action, which ﾓmade my heart glow.  Maria saves $25 per month with EARN and is saving to move into a permanent leased space within the Excelsior. She hopes that continued growth will allow her to add some paid staff to her volunteer-run organization."

In 2002, she did finally take her friends' advice and began making candy out of her home and selling it through street fairs.  She saw an unmet demand for quality southern-style baked goods in her Bayview neighborhood. She left a long career working for the city of San Francisco and in 2006 she realized her dream of opening her own store, Pralines by Yvonne.  Yvonne is a single parent raising her 6-year-old daughter in the neighborhood she has lived in for over 20 years. Although her business is successful, she still finds saving for her EARN account to be a challenge, especially in recent times.  She bakes her southern-style candy, cookies, cupcakes, cakes and pies off-site in a commercial kitchen that charges her between $300 and $400 per month. Her savings and match will help her purchase on-site commercial ovens for her storefront, which will eventually lower her costs and increase her profits. For now, you can visit her in person or online at www.pralinesbyyvonne.com."
