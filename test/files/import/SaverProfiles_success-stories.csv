With dreams of being the first in her family to go to college, T  opened her matched-savings account while participating in a youth entrepreneurship program. Through the program, she worked at an ice cream retail store at AT&T Ballpark and saved for her college dream while attending a highly competitive high school in San Francisco.

Today, thanks to the earnings from her matched savings, T attends Mills College, where she is working towards a degree in education and planning to become a child-advocacy lawyer. Her earnings helped pay for tuition, books, and a much loved, 49ers’ red-and-black Samsung laptop. T continues to write e-newsletters and blogs to encourage other savers. Inspired by her two younger siblings, she hopes to help other young people find the resources they need to achieve their educational goals.

But in order to advance, she would have to go back to school. With two daughters to care for and a grandchild on the way, Dee Dee didn’t think she could afford to take a financial risk, even if it meant long-term stability for her family. When she found out about matched-savings, her dreams began to crystallize. Not only would her savings be matched 2-to-1, but she would also learn how to manage her money to reach her goals.

The program was a great help, Dee Dee says, “And not just for my education. I learned how to control my spending. Now, I have a better understanding of what’s important.”

Using her matched-savings funds, Dee Dee earned a certificate in Clinical Trials Design and Management from San Francisco State University. Today, she has a rewarding job with a biotechnology firm and is building a consulting practice. With her own future secured, Dee Dee also volunteers to help others who face financial roadblocks.

Twenty years later, her recovery has exceeded everyone’s expectations, and Vicci has embarked on a mission to help others focus on the possibilities—not the limitations—of disability.

Vicci knew from experience that patients in hospital rehabilitation programs often lack the inspiration and guidance they need to rebuild their lives after an illness or traumatic accident. She saw a business opportunity in coaching people through this transition. When she learned about matched-savings, Vicci enrolled immediately and start saving for her new venture, surprised by how much help the program offered.

“The staff gave me valuable advice on how to start my business,” says Vicci. “They are the coach’s coaches.”
