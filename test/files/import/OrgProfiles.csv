People who are deemed ready for the program may have moved through a crisis or period of instability and can now pursue the exciting opportunities presented by the relationships, support, and resources of the matched savings program. ","The Midas Collaborative includes 32 non-profit organizations providing wealth-building initiatives in low-income communities across Massachusetts. Our work with working-poor families enables them to build assets, not just income; empowers them to own, not just owe; views them as savers, producers, and entrepreneurs, not just recipients, borrowers, and trainees. We invite low-income workers to be full participants in the economy.

In Midas’s model of delivering matched savings accounts, community partner organizations provide design, outreach, training, and counseling to the savers, while Midas provides back-office account management, training of staff, evaluation, and access to match funding. This collaborative approach provides flexibility to fit target groups and local economic conditions, while building efficiencies into managing bank accounts, raising match funds, and collecting evaluation data. In a state with great disparities of income and wealth between communities, this responsive model is what has made Midas so successful.

Midas and its partners help low-wage investors to navigate and succeed by saving, increasing incomes, and making judicious use of programs that move families up and out of poverty. As one investor put it: “Before, I knew where I wanted to go, but I was going around and around, lost. Now I’m on my way, and most importantly, I have a map to get there!”","midas_logo_high_res.jpg","image/jpg"
"Opportunity Fund","San Jose","CA","www.opportunityfund.org","(408) 297-0204","opportunityfund@savetogether.org",1993,1999,605,2697,"$4,441,587.00","$7,293,971.00","Opportunity Fund savers profiled on SaveTogether have met with a case manager to discuss their short- and long-term financial goals and have demonstrated their determination to succeed. These savers have houshold incomes under 200% of the federal poverty line (approximately $44,000 for a family of 4) and limited assets. Before being posted on SaveTogether, savers have attended a comprehensive financial education course, opened a savings account, and saved successfully for at least 6 months without missing a deposit.","Opportunity Fund advances the economic well-being of working people by helping them earn, save, and invest in the future. We believe that everyone should have the chance to build a dignified life, regardless of their economic background. Our work is based on the powerful idea that assets — a home, a business, an education — are key to helping families realize their dreams and move beyond worrying about how to get by day to day.

Opportunity Fund’s savers are the working people of the San Francisco Bay Area. We reach out across neighborhoods, languages, and cultures to find individuals who are working hard every day just to make ends meet and have a vision of a brighter future for themselves and their families. Our savers earn, on average, just $24,000 a year, but save an average of 4% of their gross income. Most of our savers are women (72%) and many of them are single parents (40%). 

Since 1999, nearly 2,700 savers have saved more than $4 million of their own income and Opportunity Fund has matched each dollar 2:1. With their hard-earned nest egg, our savers have purchased homes, become entrepreneurs, started retirement accounts, and invested in higher education.  

Our results to date include:
• More than 2,500 families have completed comprehensive financial education & saved with our program
• 1,800 savers have invested in a home, small business, college education or retirement fund. 
• 75% of graduates continue to save after completing the program.
• 70% of graduates open savings accounts for their children.
• 95% of graduates who invest in education stick to their plan and complete their degree","opportunity_fund_logo.jpg","image/jpg"
"Neighborhood Assets","Spokane","WA","www.snapassets.org","(509) 456-7174","snapwa@savetogether.org",1966,2001,135,374,"$662,569.00","$298,951.00","Participating savers must have household income below 200% of the federal poverty level (roughly $44,000 for a family of four) and net household assets of less than $10,000 excluding home equity and one car. They must have earned income to qualify for a matched savings account.","Neighborhood Assets is a Community Development Financial Institution and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners (SNAP), a community action agency that was founded more than 40 years ago.  Neighborhood Assets provides opportunities that empower low income people to become financially stable and build wealth for a prosperous future.  All services, including money management, credit repair, savings and investment incentives, credit-builder loans, and small business development, are focused on meeting people where they are and helping them to start on a journey toward prosperity.  

Neighborhood Assets began offering matched savings accounts in 2001, focusing exclusively on public assistance recipients, and since that time the program has expanded to serve a wide range of low and moderate income people and refugees in the Spokane area.  We have enrolled nearly 400 individuals to date in our matched savings account program, making our program one of the largest and most experienced in the state.  We currently have over 130 active participants, with an average of $644 in savings in their accounts, pursuing a mixture of goals including entrepreneurship, post-secondary education, and home ownership.  

Neighborhood Assets delivers strong outcomes for its savers. A sample of 33 graduates shows that one year after graduation:

• All homebuyers still own homes, all businesses are still open, and all of the participants who invested in education have received their degree or are still on track to finish;
• 55% are still saving on a monthly basis toward new goals;
• 88% still track their spending, and follow a budget;
• Only one has used a payday loan;
• 97% are still employed.

Matched savings accounts help transform lives, and Neighborhood Assets is considered an exemplary program in the matched savings field.

"EARN","San Francisco","CA","www.earn.org","(415) 217-3660","sfearn@savetogether.org",2001,2001,1369,2516,"$2,800,000.00","$6,900,000.00","EARN Savers are working people whose household income is less than 200% of the federal poverty threshold (roughly $44,000 for a family of four) at the time of their enrollment in the EARN program. They must be working at least part time in order to open a matched savings account.","The Earned Assets Resource Network (EARN), creates new cycles of prosperity for low wage workers by helping them invest in college education, micro-enterprises, and first homes - assets that will secure their futures and the futures of their children. 

EARN was established in 2001 with the intent to fulfill 3 core promises: 

1. Use matched savings accounts, and related services, such as financial education and financial planning, to empower local low-wage workers to create prosperity across generations. 

2. Deliver our financial literacy and matched accounts in a way that can be replicated at scale in San Francisco, the Bay Area, California, and the US.

3. Drive the local and state policy changes required to bring financial literacy and matched accounts to scale. 

Today, EARN operates one of the largest and fastest-growing matched savings account programs in the country.  Our 2500+ Savers have saved over $3.5 million of their own money since 2002. We aim to provide a matched savings account for college, and financial education for all of the 14,000 eligible families in San Francisco by 2012. EARN will also make financial coaching available to thousands of low income workers by 2010, directly and through partnerships across the San Francisco Bay Area. 

EARN believes we can achieve these bold plans because we have successfully built an asset-building infrastructure in San Francisco with the help of key champions in government and the private sector. Since 2002, we have persuaded the Mayor, Treasurer, Board of Supervisors, and Department Heads to invest in asset building as a strategy to create opportunity. As a result, tens of thousands of underbanked and low-income people are being served every year through unique programs directed and funded by the City.

All of EARN’s work is guided by our core values of prosperity, dignity, innovation, and scale. We aim to model asset building services in a way that can be replicated by organizations across the country, but our success is measured best by the achievements of our Savers: hard-working people who struggle to create a better future for themselves and their families. By helping EARN Savers build assets and achieve their dreams of prosperity, you are investing in their families, their communities, and their future.
