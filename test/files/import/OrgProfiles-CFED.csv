"CFED","Washington","DC","www.cfed.org",,"cfed@savetogether.org","For over 30 years, the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED) has worked nationwide coordinating community practice, public policy and private markets to open real economic opportunity for communities on the margins of the economy.
Since the conception of the Individual Development Account in 1990 CFED has led the development of the matched savings field in the United States.  Since that time, matched savings has grown as a practice to 500 communities in every state serving roughly 82,000 Americans. CFED has worked with policy makers to enact supportive federal and state policy with bipartisan backing, and with private sector institutions to develop innovative financial products and partnerships that benefit low-income families.
Most notably, CFED has demonstrated the value and tested approaches to matched savings programs through large-scale pilot programs. CFED organized the American Dream Demonstration, which ran from 1997-2002, the first large-scale, comprehensively evaluated test of the efficacy of Individual Development Accounts.  And in 2003, CFED led the Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship and Downpayment (SEED) initiative to test matched savings programs for children and youth at 12 widely diverse sites around the nation.
Throughout, CFED has worked to support and grow the IDA field by sponsoring conferences and providing training and resources for IDA providers.  Additionally CFED has used its experience to advocate for federal funding of IDAs through legislation such as the Assets for Independence Act and the Savings for Working Families Act, and for support at the state level as well.
Today, through the American Dream Match Funds (ADMF), CFED is working to create a collaborative program that will connect people who have had the opportunity to live the American Dream with families who are working still to achieve it against long odds. The Bay Area Match Fund is the pilot and springboard for ADMF that will allow CFED and its partners to expand the matched savings infrastructure.","CFED_Color_Logo.gif","image/gif"
