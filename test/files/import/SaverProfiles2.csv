Growing up within an immigrant family from Hong Kong, confronted by an ominous language barrier, Angela didn't appreciate the true value of education until she dropped out of high school for a year and worked at Dunkin Donuts for 8 months.  With a renewed passion and sense of urgency to continue her studies, she finished high school and worked three jobs to finance her post-secondary education at Cambridge College as a full time student.  After many sleepless nights, she successfully graduated with a B.S. in liberal arts, participated in an internship with Year Up and joined the matched savings program.  

Just a few months ago, she began her career in international finance with a new job at a firm in Quincy.  In hopes of achieving a better life, Angela's goal is to save $1,500 through the JVS/Midas matched savings program.  She is not unfamiliar with planning a budget and sticking to it'a skill exemplifying maturity and discipline that has already helped her save $830 of the $1,500 goal.  Her savings and match will go towards her tuition at BU where she will be taking Accounting and Microeconomics in the fall.  One day she hopes to join a financial firm that will allow her to represent the United States on the international stage.  Ultimately, she is eager to use her knowledge and experience to help others."

When she was young, her mother was her motivation, her reason for succeeding. While attending St. Paul Elementary School in San Francisco, she lost her motivation: when Rosanna was ten, her mother passed away. She began to attend Leadership High School, a public charter school in the Bay Area. Being raised by her low-income grandparents made college look impossible. In late 2008 Rosanna's friend, Natalie, informed her about an opportunity to join Juma Ventures and in March, 2007, Rosanna was hired.
 
She participated in after-school tutoring, financial education classes, and even the Southern California College Tour.  Juma has helped me accomplish my goals as a student,  Rosanna said they have taught me how to be a mentor to people younger than me.  In late 2007, Rosanna opened up her matched savings account.  It helps me with overcoming my financial obstacles at school. It's just one less thing I have to worry about.  Rosanna admits that she still does unnecessary spending from time to time, but Juma helped her differentiate needs and wants and taught her how to budget. She even had money deposited directly into her matched savings account.
 
Rosanna knows the meaning of hard work. Resisting peer pressure and overcoming financial struggles, Rosanna made it through her freshman year at California State University Los Angeles. She has already used some of her match funds to purchase books, and she continues to save. She is now a sophomore ready to declare her major as Sociology. In due time, Rosanna intends to be a probation officer.

"Juma Ventures","Juma Ventures_Yaman_A.jpg","jumaventures+yamanadeina@savetogether.org","Yaman","Ahmed","San Francisco","CA","Education",1000,"As the fourth of six siblings, Yaman is the first to graduate from Abraham Lincoln High School and attend college.  Though he is unsure of exactly what he wants to major in, Yaman knows that he wants to help people. He has set his mind on working with a non-profit to help people from Yemen, his native country. He credits his motivation and work ethic to the lessons he learned from Juma Ventures.

Before Juma, I was lazy. All I wanted to do was hang out with my friends. And my grades? Wow! My grades were really bad. Then on top of it my morale was low, which discouraged me even more. Juma changed all that.  In August 2008, Yaman joined Juma Ventures with only the intention of making money. Very soon after, he learned it was about much more than money. He began to take advantage of the tutoring services as well as the SAT preparation classes taught by the Juma staff. He also opened his matched savings account and began saving immediately.

I'm a good saver. I have 30% of my check directly deposited into my accpimt so that I donï¾’t have to worry about making bank trips. It's just easier.  After attending numerous financial education classes, Yaman knows that his matched savings account is a great opportunity that will help him keep up with school costs: The money will be there for me when I don't have enough for my tuition. Yaman has also learned about credit and how important it is to manage your debt and pay what you owe. 

As a freshman in college, Yaman advises other students in his circumstances to apply for a matched savings account and take control of their financial future.

He participated in all the activities offered including tutoring and financial literacy classes. He attended many sessions about money management, not even realizing that he was investing in his own future. During this time, he opened up two savings accounts, including one that would be specifically for his college savings. In 2008, Jesus opened his matched savings account with Juma Ventures and began saving for college regularly with money he made as one of the top vendors at Juma's ball park concession stands.

After enrolling into UC Santa Cruz as a potential Sociology major, Jesus has gained the self-confidence and motivation that he needs to continue to save and succeed without excuses. With his matched savings account helping to assure that he can complete his degree, Jesus is proud to know that he will break the family cycle of poverty by obtaining an education.
